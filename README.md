# Feel the Rhythm

*Feel the Rhythm* is a one button game created in Unity by Frederik Schneider.

This Project is the final task for the **Game Entwicklung (Unity) â€“ One Button** class by Linda Kruse.

*Keep in mind: This is the 1.0.0 Release Version! If you find any bugs, let me know.*

## Game Description

It is time to test your Rhythm and your reflexes. Each level has a different difficulty.
Learn and feel the Beat to get points, but pay attention to the random "**STOPS!**" in the music, to prevent you from getting minus points.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository
- Open the projekt in Unity

### Prerequisites

- Currently build in Unity 2020.3.27f
- Optimized for WebGL (only) 

## WebGL Latency/Loading Issue

- There is a bug with WebGL, that causes problems with the loading/latency of the music in each level. This bug can may or may not occur on your browser.
**WORKAROUND:** Go to the "How to Play" or "Song List" page and head back to the Main Menu. If the the problem still exist, try to reload the tab in your browser.
